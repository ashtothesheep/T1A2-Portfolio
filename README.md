## Description

First website build that incorporates everything I've learned during my first 3 weeks with CoderAcademy. 
I have opted to just include a lot more hobby related stuff instead of using it like a proper Portfolio because it's my first time in this space.

It contains
- An about me section
- Portfolio page with various projects
- Blog page with blog posts
- Link to my resume
- A contact me page, that's kinda functional, well the buttons work.

## Resources used

Multiple resources were used for this project. 
I will list all of the resources used during this project below, with explanations.

1. [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) 
    Utilised CSS Tricks guides extensively, especially the attached flexbox link, as it is in a format that is easily accessible and viewable. 
2. [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
    W3 Schools provided a lot of guides on formatting pages and components for CSS and HTML. They also included a lot of information and suggestions on animations used. 
3. [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    Used FontAwesome for social media icons and download buttons.
4. [GoogleFonts](('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins&display=swap');)
    This is where I got the font I used throughout this project from.

Other than the above sites, I also used other tools to help me cover the assignment:

- Figma for wireframes
- Draw.io for sitemap
- Netlify for deployment
- Pitch.com for slide decks



## Features:

- Mobile first design that adjusts to the scale of the browser window
- Animation on the Blog Cards on Home PAge
- Changing colours animations on hover around links 
- Downloadable CV in About me and Index page
- Contact form
- Easy navigation buttons to cycle through Blog
- Social media footer with clickable icons
